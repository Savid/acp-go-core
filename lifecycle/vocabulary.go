// Package lifecycle implements the acp-go.dev/lifecycle extension: the closed
// event vocabulary, the strict wire decoder, the projection reducer, and the
// ordered emitter one session incarnation writes through.
//
// The extension carries, in ACP v1 _meta, a prompt lifecycle in which a
// prompt is answered on acceptance and turns and background work are reported
// through session updates.
//
// The reducer handles the whole event set, including events a given sibling's
// configuration never emits, because the same code validates the stream a
// sibling writes: a validator that only handles what one harness produces
// cannot detect the case where it produces something else.
